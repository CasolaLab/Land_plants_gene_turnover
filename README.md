# Land_plants_gene_turnover
Gene turnover rates analysis across seed plantss
This is a repository of data from the Casola and Koralewski manuscript entitled 'Pinaceae show elevated rates of gene turnover that are robust to incomplete gene annotation'
The project consists in an evolutionary computational analysis of gene turnover rates in gene families across sixteen land plant species
The main tool used is CAFE, see https://github.com/hahnlab/CAFE
The repository contains the gene family datasets used in this project
